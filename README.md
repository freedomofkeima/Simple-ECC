# SIMPLE-ECC

By: Iskandar Setiadi (freedomofkeima)

## Development Environment

- Linux/UNIX based Operating System

- C Language (C11) with GNU GMP 6.0 support (https://gmplib.org/)

## Requirements

** Install GNU GMP 6.0 **

1. Install GNU GMP 6.0 in your system (read the details in: https://gmplib.org/)

## How to Run

Use the following syntax for compilation process:

    make

Use the following syntax to run the application:

    make run
    
Also, you can define parts that you're interested in at main.c (as the following):

    // Define your TEST here
    
    #define TEST_MODULAR_OPERATION true
    
    #define TEST_SCALAR_OPERATION true
    
    #define TEST_SCALAR_ALGORITHM true
    
    #define TEST_ENCRYPT_DECRYPT true
    
    #define TEST_SIMPLIFIED_ECIES true


## Additional Information

This project is using RDTSC & RDTSCP for measuring average running time. ( Reference: https://idea.popcount.org/2013-01-28-counting-cycles---rdtsc/ )

Make sure to "warm up" the code before benchmarking. (avoid cache effects in the first iteration)

The report of this project will be published later.
